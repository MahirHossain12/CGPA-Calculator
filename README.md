# ðŸŽ“ CGPA Calculator for University Students (4.0 Scale)

This is a simple **terminal-based CGPA calculator** built in Python. It helps students calculate their overall CGPA and last 2 years' CGPA (typically semesters 5â€“8) based on the grades and credit hours of individual courses. This tool is particularly useful for **University of Dhaka CSE students**, but it can be adapted to any university that uses a **4.00 GPA scale**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

* Menu-driven interface with simple options for grades and credit hours.
* Supports all 8 semesters and allows skipping any semester.
* Calculates:

  * **Overall CGPA**
  * **CGPA of the last 2 years (Semesters 5â€“8)**
* Saves the final result in a file named `cgpa_results.txt`.
* Easy to understand, beginner-friendly code â€” ideal for learning.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. The user is asked to enter the number of courses for each semester (1 to 10).
2. For each course, the user selects:

   * The **grade** (from options like A+, A, B+, etc.)
   * The **credit hours** (from a list of standard university values)
3. The program multiplies the grade point by credit hours to calculate weighted points.
4. It adds up all points and credit hours across semesters.
5. It calculates:

   * The overall CGPA (all semesters combined)
   * The last 2 yearsâ€™ CGPA (based on semesters 5â€“8 only)
6. The results are displayed and saved to a text file.

## ðŸ§® Grade Point Mapping (4.0 Scale)

| Grade | Point |
| ----- | ----- |
| A+    | 4.00  |
| A     | 3.75  |
| A-    | 3.50  |
| B+    | 3.25  |
| B     | 3.00  |
| B-    | 2.75  |
| C+    | 2.50  |
| C     | 2.25  |
| D     | 2.00  |
| F     | 0.00  |
